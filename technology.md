# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis along with excel and the various functiosn that reside within excel. Further analysis will be completed using Python once we drill down the specific data that we want. 

## Database Storage
PgAdmin and SQL are the database and platform we will be using to integrate our data. We will integrate our data using Flask and hope to host it using Heroku.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. The type of machien learning we will use will be supervised machine learning. We will create both a linear regression model and a multivariate linear regression model to determine which fits our needs better. We will not need to use a Deep Learning Model as our data is pretty straightforward. 

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. Additionally, we will hopefully integrate the ML process into our webpage so that it can predict the outcomes of inputs. It will be hosted on Heroku.
