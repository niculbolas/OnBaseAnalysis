# Selected Topic
Baseball statistics.

## Topic Selection Reason:
This group consists of several sports fans and so we were enthuisastic about the opportunity to show off our new coding skills on a set of data involving something we all enjoy.

## Description of Source Data:
The data used in this project is sourced from https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/.  This is a large database of baseball data in various formats such as csv, MySQL, SQLite, or MS Access that is maintained and updated primarily by Sean Lahman.  The best description of the data comes straight from the website readme found at https://www.seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2021.txt:

>  This database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for
  Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2021.  It includes data from
  the two current leagues (American and National), the four other "major" 
  leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and
  Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875. 

 > This database was created by Sean Lahman, who pioneered the effort to
  make baseball statistics freely available to the general public. What
  started as a one man effort in 1994 has grown tremendously, and now a
  team of researchers have collected their efforts to make this the
  largest and most accurate source for baseball statistics available
  anywhere. (See Acknowledgements below for a list of the key
  contributors to this project.)

  > None of what we have done would have been possible without the
  pioneering work of Hy Turkin, S.C. Thompson, David Neft, and Pete
  Palmer (among others).  All baseball fans owe a debt of gratitude
  to the people who have worked so hard to build the tremendous set
  of data that we have today.  Our thanks also to the many members of
  the Society for American Baseball Research who have helped us over
  the years.  We strongly urge you to support and join their efforts.
  Please vist their website (www.sabr.org).

## Questions to Answer:
The question we seek to answer is that which baseball statistics, if any, can be used to accurately predict a team's win/loss ratio for a given season.  We will compare the accuracy of prediction between several different baseball statistics to determine which gives the best prediction or perhaps which combination of baseball statistics yields the best prediction.
